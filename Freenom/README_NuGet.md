# Freenom

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/actually-akac/Freenom/master/Freenom/icon.png)

An async C# library for automatically renewing Freenom domains.


> **Warning**
> This library doesn't implement domain registration and configuration GUI API routes, as these can be easily abused for spam.

## Usage
Available on NuGet as `Freenom.NET`, methods can be found under the class `FreenomClient`.

https://www.nuget.org/packages/Freenom.NET

## Dependencies
- `HtmlAgilityPack` ([GitHub](https://github.com/zzzprojects/html-agility-pack)) ([Website](https://html-agility-pack.net/)): For efficiently parsing the DOM and reading data out of it.

## Example
Under the `Example` folder you can find a demo application that implements the library.

## Code Samples

### Creating a new Freenom client 
```csharp
FreenomClient freenom = new();
```

### Logging in
```csharp

```

### Getting basic account information

```

### Getting all domains under the account that might be renewable

### Filter for domains that are currently renewable using LINQ
```csharp

```csharp
long orderId = await freenom.RenewDomain(6236693445, 12);
```
